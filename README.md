# Advanced Data Analysis on Retail Performance Metrics

## Introduction
**Leveraging SQL and Python to Extract Actionable Insights from Retail Data and Drive Business Performance**

This project demonstrates my expertise in SQL for complex data analysis tasks, as well as Python for basket analysis. By calculating key metrics such as retention rates, growth indicators, burn rates, and more, I provide actionable insights to enhance business performance in the retail sector. The analysis is visualized using Plotly to provide clear and interactive insights.

## Project Overview

### Objective
Analyze retail performance data to uncover trends, identify growth opportunities, and optimize costs.

### Key Analyses
1. **Monthly Retention Rate**
   - Calculated for February, focusing on customers retained from January.
   - Retention rate analyzed by channel, with recommendations for improvement.

2. **Growth Metrics**
   - Percentage growth in orders, distinct retailers, average order price, and total revenues from January to February.

3. **Burn Analysis**
   - Monthly burn calculated for January and February, with strategies to reduce discount burn.

4. **Channel Contribution**
   - Weekly percentage contribution of each channel to total orders for January and February.

5. **Product Margin Analysis**
   - Top 20 products identified by total margin, along with those needing intervention.

6. **Category Contribution**
   - Change in category contribution between January and February, analyzed in terms of sales and margins.

7. **Retailer Ranking**
   - Retailers ranked based on business importance, with a discussion on additional relevant metrics.

8. **Basket Analysis**
   - Performed using Python and visualized with Plotly to uncover purchasing patterns and trends.

## SQL Code
### Functions Used in SQL Scripts
- **ALTER TABLE** - Used to add new columns to an existing table.
- **UPDATE** - Updates the existing records in a table.
- **CAST** - Converts an expression of one data type to another.
- **LEFT** - Extracts a number of characters from the left side of a string.
- **RIGHT** - Extracts a number of characters from the right side of a string.
- **GETDATE()** - Returns the current date and time.
- **YEAR()** - Extracts the year part from a date.
- **MONTH()** - Extracts the month part from a date.
- **BEGIN...END** - Used to group multiple SQL statements into a single block.
- **SELECT INTO** - Creates a new table and inserts the result of a query into it.
- **DISTINCT** - Removes duplicate records from the result set.
- **COUNT()** - Returns the number of rows that match a specified criterion.
- **INNER JOIN** - Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
- **DECLARE** - Defines variables.
- **SET** - Assigns a value to a variable.
- **AVG()** - Returns the average value of a numeric column.
- **SUM()** - Returns the total sum of a numeric column.
- **GROUP BY** - Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data.
- **ROW_NUMBER()** - Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a result set.
- **ORDER BY** - Sorts the result set in either ascending or descending order.
- **WITH** - Defines a common table expression (CTE) that can be referenced within the query.
