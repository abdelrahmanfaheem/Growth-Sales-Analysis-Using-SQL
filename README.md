# Advanced Data Analysis on Retail Performance Metrics

## Introduction
**Leveraging SQL and Python to Extract Actionable Insights from Retail Data and Drive Business Performance**

This project demonstrates my expertise in SQL for complex data analysis tasks, as well as Python for basket analysis. By calculating key metrics such as retention rates, growth indicators, burn rates, and more, I provide actionable insights to enhance business performance in the retail sector. The analysis is visualized using Plotly to provide clear and interactive insights.

## Project Overview

### Objective
Analyze retail performance data to uncover trends, identify growth opportunities, and optimize costs.

### Key Analyses
1. **Monthly Retention Rate**
   - Calculated for February, focusing on customers retained from January.
   - Retention rate analyzed by channel, with recommendations for improvement.

2. **Growth Metrics**
   - Percentage growth in orders, distinct retailers, average order price, and total revenues from January to February.

3. **Burn Analysis**
   - Monthly burn calculated for January and February, with strategies to reduce discount burn.

4. **Channel Contribution**
   - Weekly percentage contribution of each channel to total orders for January and February.

5. **Product Margin Analysis**
   - Top 20 products identified by total margin, along with those needing intervention.

6. **Category Contribution**
   - Change in category contribution between January and February, analyzed in terms of sales and margins.

7. **Retailer Ranking**
   - Retailers ranked based on business importance, with a discussion on additional relevant metrics.

8. **Basket Analysis**
   - Performed using Python and visualized with Plotly to uncover purchasing patterns and trends.
